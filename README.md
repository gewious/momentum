# Momentum ðŸŒ¸
Momentum is an analogue of the Chrome Web Store application of the same name. The application shows the time and username. The background image and greeting changes depending on the time of day.
The application has a clock, an image slider, weather widgets, an audio player, a quote of the day block, and settings. Local storage is used to store the username and location. You can also choose 3 image sources: a collection of images from github, Unsplash API or Flickr API.  
I made the design based on the characters from the computer game League of Legends.  
## Main skills:  
* element search methods;  
* data output to the page;  
* work with date and time;  
* work with audio;  
* saving data in local storage;  
* using recursive setTimeout;  
* division of js-code into modules;  
* work with asynchronous requests.
